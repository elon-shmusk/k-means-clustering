# k-means-clustering
cs392-final-project

This project is an implementation of the naive k-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm). There are 3 versions of the program: Serial, parallel with OpenMP and parallel with CUDA.

To run this program you can either use randomly generated data by supplying command line arguments or load data from a csv file. All 3 versions support n-ary sized data. The sample housing data is not provided in this github repo but can be downloaded from the misc section google drive link.
